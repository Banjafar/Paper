  Interaction of solid materials with laser pulses of \SI{1e16}{\watt\per\cm}
  produces warm dense matter under controlled laboratory conditions.
  Multilayer targets of alternating high and low Z material layers of a few
  nanometer thickness open the possibility
  to study the laser--matter interaction dynamics as a volumetric effect by
  observing the multilayer Bragg peak in a x--ray reflectometry experiment.
  Here, we present particle--in--cell simulations of
  the laser and multilayer target interaction and subsequent calculations of
  the reflectivity as a
  function of reflection angle and various time delays between the optical pump
  and the x--ray probe pulse delivered by an x--ray free--electron laser.
  Using the same methodology, we also calculate the diffuse x--ray scattering
  signal.
  We demonstrate that the combined measurement of reflectivity and
  diffuse scattering provides valuable information about the evolution of
  electron density gradients, temperature and ionization as a function of target
  depth and pump--probe time delay and Bragg peak position.

The warm dense matter regime is a state of matter in which the materials have been exposed to the high pressure of 1 Mbar and have the properties of both plasma and solid state. In such a condition the temperature of the electrons varies from a few eV to 100 eV and the density is typically from solids up to highly compressed. These unique physical properties of WDM and its importance and practical applications in physics of planetary formation like the interior layers structure, convection, magnetic field, and charge transfer inside the gas giants and the core of Earth-like planets [], inertial confinement fusion where the material is encountered during the implosion phase [], plasma optics [], and material science [] have made it an exciting topic to study. However, this unique position of WDM in density and temperature space makes this area of physics very challenging to investigate. Actually, this state of matter can be produced in the laboratory by irradiating a very thin foil with a few tens of nm thickness by femtosecond optical laser pulses with $10^{15}-10^{16}$ $W/cm^2$ intensity []. But, for usual optical diagnostic techniques, WDM acts like an opaque because of the high density of free electrons. Thus, in order to obtain physical information like density profile and temperature from inside the WDM other techniques such and proton and X-ray radiography have been commonly using [].

Some novel techniques in laser--plasma interactions such and plasma mirrors[], in which a femtosecond laser pulse is efficiently reflected by the dense plasma with higher temporal contrast and tighter focusing, and using pre-pulses [], which often precede the main high-intensity laser pulse, are categorized in the WDM regime due to the up to $10^{16}$ $W/cm^2$ intensity of the laser pulses that is commonly used in these technique. In these cases, having a good knowledge of the surface structure such as nano-scale roughness and surface dynamics like plasma hydrodynamic expansion is very important to optimize the experiments. Here, X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) has the capability to provide high temporal (femtosecond) and spacial (nanometer) resolution that is crucial to get some information from the surface of hot dense plasma. It also provides a very good vision of electron density gradient and the opacity [] of warm dense plasma. Some X-ray probing techniques such as X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) [] are particularly sensitive to the sample electron distribution in the plane and in the direction perpendicular to the substrate surface, by which we are able to simply obtain the depth-resolved structure characterization by altering the incidence angle.

In this work, we present Particle--in--Cell simulation and X--ray reflectometry study of interaction of a $10^{16}$ $W/cm^2$ intensity optical laser pulse with a multilayer target based on an experiment with the same geometry.

\section{Experiments}

A brief explanation about the theory.

\section{Modeling}
\label{S:2}
\subsection{Particle--in--Cell simulation}
A schematic of 2D PIC simulation setup has been shown in (figure). The simulation was done by PIConGPU code [reference] on $4096 \times 4096$ cells that the dimension of each cells is 2.5 {\AA} in both direction and the time step is ${\Delta}t=5.89 \times 10^{-4}$ fs. Thus, the dimension of simulation box is nearly $1 \times 1$ $\mu m$ and the total time of simulation is 527 fs. An optical laser pulse with plane wave profile, intensity $I = 10^{16}$ $W/{cm}^2$ corresponds to $a_{0} = 0.068$ for 800 $nm$ laser wavelength, and the pulse duration $\tau_{FWHM}=50$ fs, and focal spot size of 5 $\mu m$  comes alongside the $y$ axis and incidents normally on the front of multilayer (ML) target, which is a 10 times reps of Tantalum, $n_{Ta} = 5.55 \times 10^{22}$ $cm^{-3}$, and Aluminum ,$n_{Al} = 6.022 \times 10^{22}$ $cm^{-3}$, double-layers. The thickness of each layer is 5 $nm$ and regarding the 20 $nm$ Silicon substrate, the total thickness of the target is 120 $nm$. Three kinds of ionization model, barrier suppression ionization (BSI) [reference], Thomas-Fermi (TF) [reference], and the tunnel ionization (ADK) [reference] have been used in our simulation, while it dose not include the collision process. In fact, quantitative modeling of WDM is a critical challenge for kinetic method such as particle--in--cell and radiation--hydrodynamics mainly due to (a) difficulties in describing the ionization dynamics; (b) uncertainty about electron-ion collision frequency which governs absorption, heat transfer and plasma conductivity; and (c) violation of the heat conduction models at the steeped temperature gradient present in laser excited plasma []. However,

\subsection{X-ray diffraction}

\section{Results and discussion}
The figure (figure) is a closeup view the free (first row), bound (second row), and total electron density (third row) 2D maps at 0, 75, 226, and 410 fs of the PIC simulation. The maximum intensity of the lase pulse reaches the target at the time 0 and it goes of the simulation box around 75 fs. One can easily see the ionization process and generation of free electrons, reduction of bound electrons, and the evolution of total electron density when the laser pulse irradiates the target and even after that. Due to skin depth of Ta and Al the laser pulse is not able to penetrate more than a few nanometer into the target and will be partially reflected when it reaches the critical density, but due to the laser ponderomotive force electrons at the front of target will be pushed into the deeper layers. Regarding the high density of target, which is hundreds of the critical density, and the intensity of laser the term of $\vec{J} \times \vec{B}$ acceleration is negligible compare the dc-ponderomotive [reference]. However, due to penetration of laser into the skin depth, the magnetic part of Lorentz force is able to drag some electrons and pull them out into the vacuum causing the field is maintained zero inside the target [reference]. The most of the dragged electrons will be pushed back into the target by inversing the laser field during a cycle causing an oscillation perpendicular to the surface of the target.

By following up the total electron density evolution in figure (figure), one can easily see that the surface of the layers get more roughed and those roughness become lager by the time. It also can be seen in figure (diffraction images), which displays three diffraction pattern as a function of $Q$ in x and y direction in ln-scale corresponding to -51.8, 160.3, and 341.9 fs. The diffraction images show the specular signal as a high intensive streak and also the diffuse scattering signal as a ring around the center by which we are able to interpret the scale of the roughness. That means larger ring for diffuse scattering signal corresponds to the smaller scale roughness and vice versa. By this definition, we can relate the large ring at -51.8 fs to the angstrom scale roughness which are mainly due to random distribution of particles inside the angstrom scale simulation cells. By the time the ring gets smaller and for larger $Q$-values there is only a weak scattering signal that means the scale of the roughness gets lager due to the irradiation. This dynamic can also be seen in figure (radial intensity figure a) shows a more detailed distribution of the radial intensity of scattered X-ray as a function of $Q$ for different time from -70 fs (red) to 395.9 fs (blue). Figure (radial intensity figure a) depicts the maximum of the scattered intensity as a function of time displaying a reduction of intensity until its minimum value at 124.6 fs that correspond to the three quarter of optical laser pulse.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{paper_plot.png}
\caption{2D electron density maps}
\end{figure}

The figure (figure) shows the averaged total electron density along the transverse direction in which 0 fs shows the moment that peak of the laser pulse reaches the surface of the target and 75.4 fs is right after the laser pulse. It can obviously be seen that due to the radiation pressure during the laser pulse, almost there is no expansion on the surface of the target. Besides that, the ML target maintains its structure without significant change. After the laser pulse at 75.4 fs see a few nanometer expansion of the electrons but latter due to the hydrodynamic expansion, the surface expands rapidly up to 20 $nm$  until 226 fs, and then with a lower speed up to 40 $nm$ until 452 fs. At the same time, the ML structure is deformed by the distribution of the free electrons throughout the target. This dynamic of electron density can also be seen in figure (contrast figure) that shows the scattered X-ray intensity fluctuations by speckle contrast $\beta$. As we mentioned earlier, the higher value of $\beta$ corresponds slower dynamics and it happens at the maximum intensity of the laser pulse at 0 fs. Then, $\beta$ curve drops down rapidly that corresponds to smaller intensity fluctuations and faster dynamics until 226 fs, from then it the dynamics get faster with a slower speed. It is also shown in figure (Q as time figure) that displays the variation of the Q-value as a function of time for the maximum scattered X-ray intensity. Similar to the figure (contrast figure), at 75.4 fs, right after the optical laser pulse, the Q-value drops down to the 0.5 $nm^{-1}$ which means the scale of the roughness get larger during this time. One can interpret the speed of the expansion from the slope of this graph. For instance, from 75.4 to 200 fs, Q changes by 2 $nm^{-1}$ that corresponds $\approx 1.5$ $nm$ in real space. Thus, the speed of the plasma expansion during this time is about $10^{4}$ $m/s$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Paper_plot_1D.png}
\caption{1D total electron density maps}
\end{figure}

To have a better image of these dynamics we considered some $Q$-rings with the width of $\Delta Q \approx 0.08$ $nm^{-1}$ and different radius from 0.54 to 7.60 $nm^{-1}$ which are centered at the center of diffraction pattern ring as it has been shown in figure (figure 5a of Lisa). The radius difference between the rings is $\Delta Q_r \approx 0.08$ $nm^{-1}$. Figure (5b from Lisa) shows the variation of the contrast $\beta$ for the smaller $Q$-rings up to radius 3.06 $nm^{-1}$ and figure (5c from Lisa) shows larger $Q$-rings. For the smaller $Q$-rings which correspond to lagers scale roughness we see just a small variation of contrast $\beta$. For instance, for 0.54 and 1.04 $nm^{-1}$, corresponds to (length scale! ask Lisa) $nm$ in real space, one can just see some fluctuations for $\beta$ by the time that means in large scale we are not significant dynamics. But as we go to the larger $Q$-ring values there is an obvious reduction of $\beta$ and faster dynamics for smaller scale roughness.
