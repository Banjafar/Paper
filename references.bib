  abstract  = {We demonstrate the technique of self-induced plasma shuttering as a means of suppressing prepulse energy that accompanies high-energy, ultrashort laser pulses. This technique makes possible the generation of clean, high-intensity subpicosecond laser pulses even in the presence of high levels of amplified spontaneous emission from the laser system. Low prepulse energy is important in applications such as the generation of solid-density subpicosecond plasmas.},

  abstract = {The construction of short-pulse tunable soft x-ray free electron laser sources based on the self-amplified spontaneous emission process will provide a major advance in capability for dense plasma-related and warm dense matter (WDM) research. The sources will provide 1013 photons in a 200-fs duration pulse that is tunable from approximately 6 to 100 nm. Here we discuss only two of the many applications made possible for WDM that has been severely hampered by the fact that laser-based methods have been unavailable because visible light will not propagate at electron densities of neâ‰¥1022 cm3. The next-generation light sources will remove these restrictions.},
